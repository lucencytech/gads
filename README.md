# gads (Google Adwords Golang SDK)

Package gads provides a wrapper for the Google Adwords SOAP API.  Based off of
[colinmutter/gads](https://github.com/colinmutter/gads), this version
was updated to support v201710 and additional functionality that was missing from 
the current versions.  

## Installation

~~~
	go get github.com/Getsidecar/gads
~~~

## Setup

In order to access the API you will need to sign up for an MCC
account[1], get a developer token[2] and setup authentication[3].
There is a tool in the setup_oauth2 directory that will help you
setup a configuration file.

1. http://www.google.com/adwords/myclientcenter/
2. https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/signingup
3. https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/guides/authentication

Currently, the you need to supply credentials via NewCredentialsFromParams
or NewCredentialsFromFile.  The credentials can be obtained from the file
generated in the previous step.

For example in this CLI script, I am handling a conf file via flags:

    go run cli/adgroups_awql.go -oauth ~/auth.json

NOTE: Other examples still need to be updated to support the removal of the built-in
oauth configuration file flag.

## Versions

This project currently supports v201605, v201607 and v201609.  To select
the appropriate version, import the specific package:

	  import (
	    gads "github.com/Getsidecar/gads/v201710"
	  )


## Usage

The package is comprised of services used to manipulate various
adwords structures.  To access a service you need to create an
gads.Auth and parse it to the service initializer, then can call
the service methods on the service object.

~~~ go
     authConf, err := NewCredentialsFromFile("~/creds.json")
     campaignService := gads.NewCampaignService(&authConf.Auth)

     campaigns, totalCount, err := campaignService.Get(
       gads.Selector{
         Fields: []string{
           "Id",
           "Name",
           "Status",
         },
       },
     )

> Note: This package is a work-in-progress, and may occasionally
> make backwards-incompatible changes.
